# Sprint backlog — 2026-06-11 (1–2 sprints, JTBD-mapped)

Drafted after shipping catalog-grounded AI pricing (P22), entity-resolver
wiring (P8), and mobile estimate-approval hardening on
`claude/tender-hamilton-pjhcbv`. Ordered by owner-impact per engineering
day, with the persona lens applied (glove-on, truck-based, phone/SMS
native, risk-averse): every item must reduce screen time or protect
money/trust, and every human touchpoint must be one tap.

## Sprint 1

1. **P2-034 — SMS one-tap approval transport** (JTBD #7 Admin Reduction,
   #2, #5). The single biggest persona lever still unshipped: proposals
   render to <320-char SMS with `APPROVE`/`EDIT`/`REJECT` replies,
   idempotent on MessageSid. Spec is complete in
   `wave-2-strategic-stories.md`; the keyword dispatcher (P6-028) and
   batch-approve endpoint (P2-035) it builds on are live. Web approval
   works, but the owner is in a truck — approval must come to the thumb.
2. **P2-035 markers — confidence markers on proposal renders** (JTBD #7).
   The `pricingSource: 'uncatalogued' | 'ambiguous'` and
   `catalogResolution` candidates now exist on draft payloads; surface
   them as one-line "what I wasn't sure about" markers on the proposal
   card (and the SMS tail-line once P2-034 lands). Zero new data needed.
3. **Review-UI picker for `ambiguous_entity` clarifications + ambiguous
   catalog lines** (JTBD #2, #5). The backend now emits candidate lists
   (`entityCandidates`, `sourceContext.catalogResolution`); the inbox
   card should render them as one-tap choices that patch the draft and
   move it to ready_for_review. Until then operators resolve by editing
   fields manually.
4. **Estimate entity-kind resolution** (JTBD #2). The entity resolver
   still skips `kind: 'estimate'` (no trigram index on estimates).
   Additive migration + resolver method, mirroring invoices.

## Sprint 2

5. **Voice-quality Layer-2 corpus authoring** (JTBD #1, #2, #5). The two
   `.skip`ed Layer-2 suites are waiting on corpus scripts. Author them,
   including catalog-pricing scenarios ("invoice the Hendersons for a
   condenser coil and two hours labor" → seeded catalog price asserted)
   — the `text-mode-driver` already accepts a `catalogRepo`.
6. **End-of-day digest → SMS** (JTBD #7, #10). Digest worker exists;
   route through the P2-034 transport with one-tap "APPROVE ALL"
   (delegates to the existing batch endpoint).
7. **Capacitor on-device voice spike** (JTBD #12 Field Tech). Time-boxed:
   wrap packages/web, evaluate on-device STT push-to-talk vs. the phone
   dial-in path for techs with gloves.
8. **Settings stub closure, highest-traffic three** (JTBD #7): Reminders,
   Payment methods, Deposit rules — `SettingsPage.tsx` still has
   `action: () => {}` handlers for 8 rows.

## Standing quality gates (every story)
- Dead-code removal in the same PR; no "wired later" stubs.
- `npx tsc --project tsconfig.build.json --noEmit` + unit + integration
  + (UI) Playwright viewport tests green before review.
- JTBD + persona impact stated in the PR description.

## JTBD coverage map (post-2026-06-11 state)
| JTBD | State | Biggest remaining gap |
|---|---|---|
| 1 Intake & Booking | Strong (voice FSM, caller-ID, booking holds) | Streaming STT latency (Phase 8B) |
| 2 Estimating | Strong + catalog-grounded (new) | Ambiguity picker UI; estimate entity resolution |
| 3 Scheduling | Strong (conflict checker, holds, compensation) | Voice ETA updates |
| 4 Job Execution | Partial | Voice checklists, MMS photos |
| 5 Invoicing & Payments | Strong + catalog-grounded (new) | Voice payment reminders |
| 6 Customer Mgmt | Good (AI replies, feedback) | Recurring voice scheduling |
| 7 Admin Reduction | **Weakest high-value area** | SMS one-tap transport (P2-034), digest-to-SMS |
| 8 Accounting | Partial (CSV) | QuickBooks sync (long pole, Wave 3) |
| 9 Marketing & Reviews | Good (Google reviews, drafts) | Campaign approve/send via SMS |
| 10 Reporting | Good (voice lookups) | Voice metric summaries in digest |
| 11 Emergencies | Good (emergency dispatch intent) | Live dial-override drill test |
| 12 Field Tech | Improved (mobile approval fixed) | Capacitor on-device voice |
