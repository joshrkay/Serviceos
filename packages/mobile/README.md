# @serviceos/mobile

The owner-operator mobile app (iOS + Android) — Expo + React Native + Expo
Router. Delivers the voice → AI proposal → approve (5s undo) → push-notify loop
over the existing ServiceOS API.

See the design docs:
- `docs/mobile/owner-operator-app-spec.md` — architecture
- `docs/mobile/workflows.md` — the operational workflow catalog
- `docs/plans/2026-06-19-001-feat-mobile-mvp-owner-operator-plan.md` — build plan

## Isolated project (not a root workspace) — on purpose

Unlike `packages/api|web|shared`, this package is **not** a member of the root
npm workspaces. The root `Dockerfile` runs `npm ci` against the root lockfile
while only `COPY`ing the api/web/shared `package.json`s; adding mobile to the
root workspaces would either break that `npm ci` (workspace missing from the
image) or pull the whole Expo/React Native tree into the api image. Keeping
mobile isolated makes the Railway api/web build provably unaffected.

Consequences:
- Install/run from inside this directory: `cd packages/mobile && npm install`.
- It has its own `node_modules` and `package-lock.json`.
- `@ai-service-os/shared` (pure Zod) is resolved straight from its **TypeScript
  source** — no build step. Metro (`metro.config.js` `resolveRequest`) and tsc
  (`tsconfig.json` paths + `moduleResolution: "bundler"`) map shared's `.js` ESM
  re-export specifiers to their `.ts` source, so a fresh checkout or EAS worker
  needs no built `dist`. It is not an npm dependency of this package.

## Stack notes
- **Expo SDK 52** (React 18.3.1, RN 0.76) — React aligned with `packages/web`.
- **NativeWind v4** (Tailwind v3) driven by the shared design tokens in
  `src/theme/tokens.js` (mirrors `packages/web/src/index.css`).

## Tests
- Pure-logic tests (tokens, formatters, hooks) run under **Vitest**:
  `npm test` (or, from the repo root, `npx vitest run --root packages/mobile`).
- React Native component-render tests use **jest-expo**: `npm run test:rn`.

## Running & viewing the app

All commands run from inside `packages/mobile`.

### Dev (Metro)
```
cp .env.example .env   # set EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL + Clerk key
npm install
npm start
```

### On your iPhone (Expo Go) — fastest, free, no Apple account
1. Install **Expo Go** from the App Store.
2. `npm install && npx expo start` (add `--tunnel` if your phone isn't on the same Wi-Fi).
3. Scan the QR with the Camera app → it opens in Expo Go with live reload.

All current deps (expo-router, nativewind, reanimated, screens, safe-area-context,
gesture-handler) are Expo SDK 52 modules supported by Expo Go, so no custom dev build is
needed yet.

### Web preview / screenshot (no device)
```
npm install
cp .env.example .env          # EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL + Clerk publishable key
# Inline env at export time — Expo bakes EXPO_PUBLIC_* into the bundle:
EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://your-api.example.com \
EXPO_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_... \
  npx expo export --platform web --output-dir web-dist
npx serve web-dist -s -l 8788  # -s = SPA fallback (required for /messages etc.)
```
The app renders via React-Native-Web (approximates iOS, not pixel-identical).

### QA against a live API (Railway preview)

Signed-in flows need a Clerk user **with tenant bootstrap** (`tenant_id` in JWT
`public_metadata`). API-created users skip the `user.created` webhook, so run:

```
DATABASE_URL='postgres://...' \
CLERK_SECRET_KEY='sk_test_...' \
  npx ts-node packages/api/scripts/bootstrap-mobile-qa-user.ts \
    --email 'mobile-qa+clerk_test@serviceos-test.com' \
    --password 'MobileQATest!123'
```

Use a `+clerk_test` email (Clerk testing mode) and re-export the web bundle
pointing at the preview API. Sign in with the printed credentials.

### TestFlight (real iOS beta) — via EAS Build
Prereqs: an **Apple Developer Program** membership ($99/yr) and a free **Expo** account.
```
npx eas-cli login
npx eas-cli build --platform ios --profile production   # store-distribution build (required for TestFlight)
npx eas-cli submit --platform ios                       # uploads to App Store Connect → TestFlight
```
TestFlight/App Store submission requires a **store-distribution** build, which is the
`production` profile in `eas.json`. The `preview` profile (`distribution: internal`) is
for ad-hoc installs on registered devices *without* TestFlight — `eas submit` rejects an
internal build. Fill in the `submit.production.ios` placeholders in `eas.json` (Apple ID,
ASC app id, team id). The build runs on Expo's servers — trigger it from your machine or a
CI job with an `EXPO_TOKEN`, not from this repo's cloud env. Replace `assets/icon.png` (a
solid-brand placeholder) with real branding before shipping.

## Testing

- **Unit / hook / screen** — `npm test` (root-hoisted Vitest). Pure logic, hooks,
  and jsdom screen contract tests (tap targets, navigation). Runs in PR CI; see
  `vitest.config.ts`. Coverage is gated (`--coverage`).
- **Viewport (Playwright)** — `npm run e2e:viewport`. Builds the web export to
  `.e2e-web` and runs `e2e/mobile-viewport.spec.ts` against it: the CLAUDE.md
  "no horizontal overflow at 320px" invariant that jsdom can't measure, plus
  ≥44px tap targets against real layout. The app is Clerk-gated, so the
  tap-target checks only run when `EXPO_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` points at a
  reachable Clerk instance (provided in CI); without it the export serves a blank
  shell and those checks skip while the no-overflow invariant still asserts. In a
  sandbox without Playwright's bundled browser, set `PW_EXECUTABLE_PATH` to a
  chromium binary.
